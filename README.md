# gentoo_install
simple installation script for gentoo linux

# How to use:
run sudo su
cd into the directory the three scripts are located
run /gentoo_install1

# How it works
I wanted to make it as simple as possible so it executes a simple bash and pushes the user inside chroot
then the user must execute the second script. This makes the code and script simple compared to other install scripts.
